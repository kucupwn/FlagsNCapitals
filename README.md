# Flags and Capitals

This is a quiz game for guessing countries by their flags. Once a correct answer is given, the game asks for the current country's capital too.

User has to input the country name by typing. If country name made up from multiple words, one has to be matched (excluding: and, of, the). 80% input text correctness is accepted.

Once the country name is guessed, 4 options come up as country capitals.
